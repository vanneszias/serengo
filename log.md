# Serengo Finds Feature Implementation Log

## Implementation Started: October 10, 2025

### Project Overview

Implementing the "Finds" feature for Serengo - a location-based social discovery platform where users can save, share, and discover memorable places with photos/videos, reviews, and precise location data.

### Implementation Plan

Based on finds.md specification, implementing in phases:

**Phase 1 (MVP):**

1. Database schema and migrations âœ“ (in progress)
2. Create Find functionality (with photos)
3. FindsMap with markers
4. FindPreview modal
5. Basic Find feed

**Phase 2:**

- Video support
- Like functionality
- Friends system
- Enhanced filters and search
- Share functionality

### Progress Log

#### Day 1 - October 10, 2025

**Current Status:** Starting implementation

**Completed:**

- Created implementation log (log.md)
- Set up todo tracking system
- Reviewed finds.md specification

**Next Steps:**

- Examine current database schema
- Add new database tables for Finds
- Set up R2 storage configuration
- Create API endpoints
- Build UI components

**Notes:**

- Following existing code conventions (tabs, single quotes, TypeScript strict mode)
- Using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- Integrating with existing auth system
- Planning for PWA offline support

**Update - Database Setup Complete:**

- âœ… Added new database tables (find, findMedia, findLike, friendship)
- âœ… Generated and pushed database migration
- âœ… Database schema now supports Finds feature

**Current Status:** Moving to R2 storage and API implementation

**Required Dependencies to Install:**

- @aws-sdk/client-s3

**Next Priority Tasks:**

1. Install AWS SDK and Sharp dependencies
2. Create R2 storage configuration
3. Implement media processing utilities
4. Create API endpoints for CRUD operations
5. Build UI components (CreateFindModal, FindPreview)

**Technical Notes:**

- Using text fields for latitude/longitude for precision
- isPublic stored as integer (1=true, 0=false) for SQLite compatibility
- Following existing auth patterns with generateFindId()
- Planning simplified distance queries for MVP (can upgrade to PostGIS later)
