## Development Standards

### Component Architecture:

- Use composition pattern with reusable SHADCN components
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Follow Svelte 5 runes pattern ($props, $derived, $effect)
- Create clean separation between UI and business logic

### Code Quality:

- Maintain existing formatting (tabs, single quotes, 100 char width)
- Use descriptive variable names and function signatures
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Add accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Performance:

- Lazy load media content and heavy components
- Implement proper caching strategies for API calls
- Use virtual scrolling for long lists when needed
- Optimize images/videos for web delivery

**Total Phase 2 Estimated Effort**: 82-105 hours
**Expected Timeline**: 8-10 weeks (part-time development)

## Next Steps:

1. Begin with Phase 2A (Modern Media Support) for immediate impact
2. Implement Phase 2B (Google Maps POI) for better UX
3. Add Phase 2C (Social Interactions) for user engagement
4. Continue with remaining phases based on user feedback
